# Coefficient-Prediction-using-ML
This program uses Linear Regression model of Machine Learning to predict the coefficients of a given input also making use of the given output.

This program uses Linear regression i.e a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).  When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression. When there are multiple input variables, literature from statistics often refers to the method as multiple linear regression.
